Live Link: https://fitness-tracker-fl6i.onrender.com/

Technologies Used: 
Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS

Styling Frameworks: Bootstrap CSS

Approach Taken: 
We began with identifying a problem that aligned with our interests and decided upon the issue of tracking fitness progress. We then created some user stories while keeping in mind our purpose for our web app:

- As a user, I want to be able to see my goals and workouts. 
- As a user, I want to easily access and see the stats of my workouts.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete/edit my workouts. 
- As a user I want my workouts timestamped.

We created wireframes for each webpage: index, show, new, edit. We created the repo that follows the MVC format (with a server.js). We installed our dependencies and established routes on our server.js, created all files (ex: .ejs .css .env), linked all files, then added content. We are using mongoDB Atlas as our database. 

This project is deployed using render.com.
